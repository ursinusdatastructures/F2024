Programmer: Chris Tralie
Purpose: To show a dynamic programming solution to the 0-1 knapsack problem
with backtracing that uses O(capacity * len(items)) time and space, and to 
apply this to find a "non-flourishing" solution to a change problem

    ## Step 1: Setup Dynamic Programming Tables
    N = len(weights)
    # Create a dynamic programming table with items down the rows and capacities across the columns
    # This is why capacity and weights have to be ints...we take all sub-capacities from 
    # 0, 1, 2, ..., capacity
    # Base cases are 0 in the top row (no elements in use) and 0 in the leftmost column (capacity 0)

    # This can be used for backtracing

                # Case 1: We take this item.  Look at the subproblem using everything up to but
                # not including this element, with a capacity of capacity_j - the weight of this item,
                # plus the value of this item since we're including it
                # We index with item_i-1 since the first row is the null item
                case1 = table[item_i-1][capacity_j - weights[item_i-1]] + values[item_i-1]
                # Case 2: We don't include the item.  In this case, we look to the best solution
                # of everything up to but not including this item

    item_i = N
    capacity_j = capacity

            capacity_j -= weights[item_i-1]
        item_i -= 1
    # Make sure this is actually an optimal solution
