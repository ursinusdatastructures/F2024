This is at worst 3 passes through an N-length array\n",

We'll explore this algorithm more in the first lab.  But it speeds up the find step, as well as the remove step (since finding is the first thing we do)\n",

    "This is a little bit trickier, but the basics are the same.  We have to find the element and then reassign pointers to circumvent the element we're trying to remove (assuming there's a garbag collector around to clean up the orphaned node).  Let's assume that it's actually there (otherwise, we just get to the end and don't do anything).  Let's also assume that it's somewhere in the middle (you'd have to handle it being the beginning as a special case).  Then the pseudocode is as follows\n",

    "The solution to a more efficient set ADT is actually incredibly simple.  We just have to combine arrays and linked lists in clever ways.  What we will do is split up our data into a bunch of *buckets*.  Each bucket will hold one small chunk of our data.  When we want to find an element, we will be able to jump directly to a bucket that would contain it if it were in our set (and likewise for removing and adding).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Students had some neat ideas in class about creating buckets.  For instance, if we knew the range of our numbers was from $a$ to $b$ and we wanted *N* buckets, then we could setup the buckets so that they contained numbers in the range\n",
    "\n",
    "* $[a, a+(b-a)/N)$\n",
    "* $[a+(b-a)/N, a+2(b-a)/N)$\n",
    "* ...\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if we wanted 4 buckets for numbers between 0 and 99, we could do buckets with ranges $[0, 24], [25, 49], [50, 74], [75, 99]$\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for this would be OK enough, but then things would get instantly messed up as soon as we made a number that went beyond the range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, there's a solution even simpler than this that works in a more general case where we don't have to assume the range!  Given $b$ buckets, we simply map a number $x$ to $x \\% b$!  For example, if we chose $b=2$, all even numbers would go into one bucket, and all odd numbers go into another bucket.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at a few different ways to implement this with numbers in python.  We'll cheat and use a random access list for now, but technically each bucket contains a *linked list*, since these are more efficient than unsorted arrays by our above discussion.  You'll implement the linked list version in your first homework\n"

    "One thing we discussed in class was the space/time tradeoff between using more buckets.  If we use more buckets, we have fewer elements that \"collide\" (i.e. occupy the same bucket) in each bucket, so it doesn't take as much time to find what we're looking for or to add/remove something.  However, it takes more memory to store the buckets.  But actually, if we use a number of buckets on the order of the number of elements we expect to have, this isn't terrible; we're just roughly doubling the amount of memory we need, but we get things more efficient.  Let's do this on the example below"
